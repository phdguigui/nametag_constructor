# Name Tag Constructor

This project was developed during the NLW Heat event, hosted by Rocketseat, so here are my greetings for this event.

## Concept

This code is a name tag constructor, where you can input your github username and link your social medias as well.

There are many comments along all the codes, since HTML till JavaScript, that's because it's a personal project I'm trying to develop across some months at the same time I learn even more the foundations of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Across the months my expect is to bring new updates, increasing more functions and possibilities at the name tag construction. Also, we're probably going to have a lot of patches along the project duration.

To each update developed and released, my objective is to build an even more complex and complete (code) name tag constructor, but mainly acquire my basis in JS coding and portfolio construction.

## Release Version

At the release version, the project base is complete, with the possibility to create your name tag changing the data inside the JS array, where you can find on the first lines of the code. The working instructions are going to be explained in some lines below.

Here you can change the anchor buttons of social medias, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube to the URL of your social network links. You can also do the same with the Github URL anchor and Github username.

The personal picture on the name tag is linked with your Github profile picture, and it changes at the same time you input your needed Github information.

### How it works:

Here is where you store your social media informations:

Inside each quotation mark, you enter your username of the related social media. 

For example, if your @ in Instagram is @crazyfrog, you'll enter "crazyfrog" between the two quotation marks, where the red box was positioned.

In standard, the creator's usernames are entered inside the quotation marks, but, the only thing to do is change the username, to the username you want to be used.

In the cases of YouTube or Facebook, where you don't have an exact username to enter, you have to get this information in the URL of your profile of each one of these sites.

## Thank you!
